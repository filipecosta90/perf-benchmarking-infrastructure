# perf-benchmarking-infrastructure


All performance benchmarks are run as instances in AWS/GCP through our benchmark testing infrastructure. In addition to the primary benchmark/performance analysis scenarios described above, we also enable running baseline benchmarks on network, memory, CPU and IO, in order to understand the underlying network and VM characteristics. 
We lay on benchmarking infrastructure represented as code, easily replicable, and stable. 


This repo aims to provide severall performance aware setups, to ensure the minimum requirements and toolset to be present.
